# Boilerplate Blog Setup

Setup is fairly straight forward

Run: docker-compose up -d after personalizing the environment variable settings in the .env file

The .env file is included only for demonstration. Your .env should not be checked into github

Once the database and strapi blog are up you can navigate to the admin site by entering
localhost:<port>

Initially you need to create an administrator

Then once you are in the admin screen create an initial author which most likely is the owner of the blog.

After that select the Blog menu item and set up the blog name, description and avatar.

Then you are ready to create posts.
